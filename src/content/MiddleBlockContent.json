    "p1": "Hey! I'm Nick Jordan, the owner and operator of PMLscapes. Starting out in 2012, we were a simple lawn care service but after graduating from the University of North Georgia with Business degree in Entrepreneurship, this service blossomed into an LLC in 2019. Today, we've evolved into a comprehensive home service- with projects spanning from simple home and lawn maintence to total home remodeling and landscaping. In 2023, a significant shift occurred as we invested in top-notch equipment, like the CAT 297C and 327T Mini skid steer, which enables us to do precision grading and groundbreaking hardscaping. Excited to partner with you in bringing your vision to life!",
